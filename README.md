# installation
You do not need any installation to start developing or using it. You just need to clone it from my [github page](https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/loginFrm) with running the command below and open the html.html file.
 `git clone https://github.com/mohammad-mohammadi88/loginFrm`

# development
This login form was made by pure [HTML](https://html.com/), and [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) that imported with [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), so you do not need to install any package to run project.
This form validated with [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) attributes and there is no [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) code to [validate forms](https://clearout.io/blog/form-validation/).
This project is good for testing your [HTML](https://html.com/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) skills.
You can even learn validating forms without any [JS](https://www.javascript.com/) code.
